# hello-world
Just another repository

Hello World!
I'm Timothy Correia-Paul, and this is my first ever use of GitHub.
I'm following the first activity guide of GitHub, found here: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
This activity guide is an introduction to the service. It contains 7 segments:
"What is GitHub?"
"Step 1. Create a Repository"
"Step 2. Create a Branch"
"Step 3. Make and commit changes". This is the section I am currently completing by creating this change to the README.md file.
"Step 4. Open a Pull Request:
"Step 5: Merge your Pull Request"
"Celebrate!"

I will document all my progress and competence in computer science and programming on this platform. This includes uploading all the work I complete, including courses, assignments, projects, etc. Through this process, I will be able to put my GitHub on my linkedin, youtube, resume, and other platforms to share my work with others, and share with people and employers the work I have done.
